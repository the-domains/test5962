is simply dummy text of the printing and 
typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy
text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of

remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with 
the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more
recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker 
including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
